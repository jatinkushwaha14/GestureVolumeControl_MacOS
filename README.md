# VolumeControl

This Jupyter Notebook provides a Python-based solution for controlling and adjusting the audio output level of your PC using gesture-based input. It calculates the volume percentage by measuring the distance between the index and thumb tips.

## Overview

The **VolumeControl** notebook allows users to control the system volume of their PC through gestures. By measuring the distance between the index and thumb tips, the notebook adjusts the system's audio output level. This hands-free approach is useful for environments where traditional volume controls are impractical.

## Features

- **Gesture-Based Volume Adjustment**: Changes the system's audio output level based on the distance between the index and thumb tips.
- **Real-Time Control**: Provides immediate feedback and volume adjustment as hand movements are detected.

## Requirements

To use this notebook, you need the following libraries:

- `opencv-python` (for capturing hand gestures)
- `mediapipe` (for hand tracking)
- `os` (for controlling the system audio)

Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
